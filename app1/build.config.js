   * This is the same as `app_files`, except it contains patterns that

   * standardized files are collected for compilation, it is the user's job
   * to ensure non-standardized (i.e. vendor-related) files are handled
   * appropriately in `vendor_files.js`.
   *
   * The `vendor_files.js` property holds files to be automatically
   * concatenated and minified with our project source files.
   *
   * The `vendor_files.css` property holds any CSS files to be automatically
   * included in our app.
   *
   * The `vendor_files.assets` property holds any assets to be copied along
   * with our app's assets. This structure is flattened, so it is not
   * recommended that you use wildcards.
